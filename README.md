Unity help:

If you have issues compiling and running the project after pulling from Github, try these steps:

* 1. Delete the offending objects (they're the ones with missing/uncompiled Mono Scripts)
* 2. Reimport the things that weren't working (like FirstPersonController)
* 3. Save
* 4. Quit and reopen Unity
* 5. It should work!

Step 1 might not be necessary. Save as and then copy in the other stuff if you want to preserve your stuff.
